# bop-null
This is a bare theme that assumes very little.

Assumes: *Bootstrap 4* and *Modernizr*.

----

**It is advisable to rename this theme before editing.** This is done in the style.css file and by renaming the theme folder.

Remember when renaming this theme to go through and change prefixes, option names, and textdomains to comply - basically do a find and replace of every instance of *bop-null* and replace with the new folder name (e.g. *bop-master*) and do the equivalent with *bop_null* (and *bop_master*).
